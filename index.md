<h2 class="col">ORM Based</h2>
JSSQL is a javascript based ORM system. ORM is programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in 
relational databases and object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, 
a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

database. Each database table has a corresponding "Model" which is used to interact with that table.
